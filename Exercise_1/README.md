# Introduction & Evaluation
The automated machine learning methods you will learn about in this course help you to improve your skill and knowledge for applying machine learning in practice.

The goal of the first part of the exercise is to set up teams and learn about git and the workflow for future exercises.
Please refer to the [pdf](doc.pdf) for full assignment instructions.

#### Extra
These assignments are done using `git`, check out [this guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) if you are unfamiliar with `git`.
There are various visual tools to help out if you're unfamiliar with the commandline, for example [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

These assignments were tested with `Python 3.9` and should work for any greater or equal version. You can check your python version by using `Python -V`.
It is highly advised to use some form of virtual environment when working on these assignments, to prevent conflicts between packages for different projects on your computer.
We recommend using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments) for this but please feel free to use any method that works for you.

We also provide a `Makefile` which has some handy commands for you if you are using the commandline while doing this assingment, run `make help` to find them!

### Content
Having learned about different ways to empirically evaluate the performances of algorithms and AutoML systems, in this exercise you will now implement some of these techniques.

### Deadline
There is no deadline for this assignment.
