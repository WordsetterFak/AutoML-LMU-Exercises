# HPO-Basics
From the lecture you have learned about evolutionary algorithms and simple methods of hyperparameter optimization.

#### Extra
These assignments were tested with `Python 3.9` and should work for any greater or equal version. You can check your python version by using `Python -V`.
It is highly advised to use some form of virtual environment when working on these assignments, to prevent conflicts between packages for different projects on your computer.
We recommend using Conda for this, but please feel free to use any method that works for you.

We also provide a `Makefile` which has some handy commands for you if you are using the commandline while doing this assingment, run `make help` to find them!
